# Metool Conventions

This directory contains coding conventions and best practices for metool development.

## Overview

These conventions ensure consistency across the metool codebase and make it easier for contributors to understand and extend the project.

## Conventions

- [Shell Scripting](shell-scripting.md) - Bash coding standards and patterns
- [Testing](testing.md) - How to write and organize tests
- [Documentation](documentation.md) - Documentation standards and structure
- [Documentation Organization](documentation-organization.md) - How to organize documentation files

## General Principles

1. **Simplicity First** - Choose the simplest solution that works
2. **Consistency** - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
3. **Portability** - Support Linux, macOS, and WSL
4. **Testability** - Write code that's easy to test
5. **Documentation** - Document complex logic and user-facing features
