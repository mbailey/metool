# Metool Conventions

Coding conventions and best practices for development of metool itself, as well as metool modules and packages.

## Overview

These conventions ensure consistency across metool and metool packages, making it easier for contributors and AI agents to understand and extend the project.

## Conventions

- [Shell Scripting](shell-scripting.md) - Bash coding standards and patterns
- [Testing](testing.md) - How to write and organize tests
- [Documentation](documentation/README.md) - Documentation standards and structure
- [Package Structure](package-structure.md) - How to structure metool packages
- [Symlinks](symlinks.md) - Symlink handling conventions

## General Principles

1. **Simplicity First** - Choose the simplest solution that works
2. **Consistency** - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
3. **Portability** - Support Linux, macOS, and WSL
4. **Testability** - Write code that's easy to test
5. **Documentation** - Document complex logic and user-facing features

## Contributing

When adding new features or modifying existing ones:

1. Follow the conventions outlined in these documents
2. Update tests to cover your changes
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Ensure all tests pass before submitting
