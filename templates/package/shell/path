# PATH configuration for {PACKAGE_NAME}
# [TODO: Replace {PACKAGE_NAME} and customize paths]
#
# This file modifies the $PATH environment variable to include directories
# containing executables for this package.
#
# FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE:
#   mt_path_prepend <dir> [<dir>...]  - Add directories to the START of $PATH
#   mt_path_append <dir> [<dir>...]   - Add directories to the END of $PATH
#
# These functions automatically:
#   - Check if directories exist before adding
#   - Avoid duplicate entries
#   - Handle multiple directories in one call
#
# WHEN TO USE PREPEND vs APPEND:
#   - Use prepend when you want your version to override system versions
#   - Use append when you want to add fallback/supplementary paths
#
# EXAMPLES:

# Prepend - makes this package's tools take precedence
# mt_path_prepend "${HOME}/.{PACKAGE_NAME}/bin"

# Append - adds additional tool locations without overriding
# mt_path_append "${HOME}/.{PACKAGE_NAME}/scripts"

# Multiple paths at once
# mt_path_prepend \
#     "${HOME}/.local/{PACKAGE_NAME}/bin" \
#     "/opt/{PACKAGE_NAME}/bin"

# Common pattern: prepend user-local, append system-wide
# mt_path_prepend "${HOME}/.local/bin"
# mt_path_append "/usr/local/{PACKAGE_NAME}/bin"

# [TODO: Remove example comments and add your actual PATH modifications below]
